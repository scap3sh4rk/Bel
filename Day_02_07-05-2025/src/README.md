STIG Compliance Check Script Report
Overview
This Python script automates Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) compliance checking for Windows Server 2019. It processes a STIG JSON file (e.g., microsoft_windows_server_2019.json) containing 276 rules, evaluates system configurations, and generates a detailed CSV report. The script handles registry-based rules, non-registry-based rules, and domain controller-specific rules, providing a comprehensive compliance assessment.
Functionalities
The script is modular, with each function serving a specific purpose. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionalities:
1. Command-Line Argument Parsing

Purpose: Configures the script via command-line arguments for input/output files, verbosity, and severity filtering.
Details:
--json: Specifies the STIG JSON file path (default: microsoft_windows_server_2019.json).
--output: Specifies the output CSV file path (default: stig_compliance_report.csv).
--verbose: Enables detailed logging to console and log file.
--severity: Filters rules by severity (high, medium, low).


Implementation: Uses argparse to parse arguments and provide user-friendly help messages.

2. Logging Configuration

Purpose: Logs script execution details, errors, and compliance results for debugging and auditing.
Details:
Creates a unique log file (e.g., stig_check_20250507_205456.log) with timestamps.
Logs to both file and console using logging module.
Verbose mode provides detailed per-rule logs (e.g., rule ID, compliance status, expected/present values).


Implementation: Configures logging.basicConfig with INFO level and dual handlers.

3. File Path Validation

Purpose: Ensures the input JSON file exists and is valid.
Details:
Validates the JSON file path using pathlib.Path.
Exits with an error if the file is missing or not a file.
Resolves the output CSV path for safe writing.


Implementation: validate_file_path function checks existence and type, logging errors via logger.

4. Domain Controller Detection

Purpose: Identifies if the system is a domain controller to skip inapplicable rules.
Details:
Uses PowerShell’s Get-CimInstance Win32_ComputerSystem to check DomainRole.
Returns True for primary (4) or backup (5) domain controllers, False otherwise.
Rules with “This applies to domain controllers” in checktext are skipped on non-domain controllers.


Implementation: is_domain_controller function runs PowerShell with error handling.

5. Registry Querying

Purpose: Retrieves registry values to check compliance for registry-based rules.
Details:
Queries HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_CURRENT_USER using PowerShell.
Caches results to avoid redundant queries, improving performance.
Sanitizes inputs to prevent command injection.
Handles types: REG_DWORD, REG_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_BINARY.
Returns (type, value, error) tuple, with statuses like NOT_PRESENT or ERROR.


Implementation: query_registry function constructs and executes a PowerShell command, parsing output.

6. Registry Details Parsing

Purpose: Extracts registry details from rule checktext for compliance checks.
Details:
Uses regex to parse:
Registry Hive (e.g., HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)
Registry Path (e.g., \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa)
Value Name (e.g., LmCompatibilityLevel)
Type (e.g., REG_DWORD)
Value (e.g., 5)


Stores checktext for additional checks (e.g., “does not exist”).


Implementation: parse_registry_details function returns a dictionary of parsed details.

7. Desired Value Extraction for Non-Registry Rules

Purpose: Determines the expected configuration for non-registry-based rules.
Details:
Analyzes checktext to extract desired values, e.g.:
Not installed for feature checks (e.g., Simple TCP/IP Services).
Enabled for audit policies.
3 or less for account lockout thresholds.


Falls back to extracting “must be” phrases or “See checktext” if unclear.


Implementation: extract_desired_value function uses keyword matching and regex.

8. Registry Compliance Checking

Purpose: Compares actual registry values with expected values to determine compliance.
Details:
Checks for:
Matching value and type (e.g., 5 as REG_DWORD).
Non-existent keys/values when expected.
Type mismatches or errors.


Returns a tuple: (compliance message, present value).
Examples:
RULE FOLLOWED (Value '5' matches expected) for compliant rules.
RULE NOT FOLLOWED (Expected 0, found 1) for non-compliant rules.




Implementation: check_registry_compliance function handles various registry types and edge cases.

9. STIG Rule Processing

Purpose: Orchestrates the processing of all STIG rules and generates the compliance report.
Details:
Loads the JSON file and extracts stig.findings.
Iterates through all rules (276 assumed), categorizing them:
Registry-Based: Queries registry, checks compliance, and populates all fields.
Non-Registry-Based: Extracts desired value, marks as Not a registry-based rule.
Domain Controller Rules: Skips on non-domain controllers with Skipped (Domain Controller Rule).


Tracks statistics: total, compliant, non-compliant, non-registry, skipped.
Sorts results by severity (high > medium > low).
Writes results to a CSV with all required fields.
Prints a summary to the console.


Implementation: process_stig_rules function coordinates all other functions and handles output.

10. CSV Report Generation

Purpose: Outputs a detailed compliance report in CSV format.
Details:
Includes columns: Rule ID, Title, Severity, Check ID, Description, Registry Hive, Registry Path, Value Name, Expected Type, Expected Value, Present Value, Compliance Report, Fix ID.
Ensures consistent field population (e.g., N/A for inapplicable fields).
Sorted by severity for prioritization.


Implementation: Uses csv.DictWriter to write sorted results.
